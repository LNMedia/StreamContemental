- Custom logic and automation for stream interactions
- Full support for extra screens (e.g. beamers or second displays)
- Future support for custom modules and third-party integrations

## 🚧 Current Status
This project is in an early development phase and serves as the foundation for a more advanced stream control system. Contributions and ideas are welcome!
